A collection of tools and coding projects I wrote to help members of the Global Formula Racing (GFR) club at Oregon State University. Written in 2015/2016 and put here on GitHub in 2017 to archive my work and reuse code snippets for later.

## "Disclaimer"
Currently, none of these are being actively improved, aside from critical fixes as requested by the team. I started coding in Google Apps Script long before learning web dev best practices. This code - apart from being changed by teammates later down the road - was never intended to be public , but simply made to "get the job done".

Please don't assume this code is *anywhere* close to perfect.

That all being said, comments/questions/suggestions for any of the code you see here would be much appreciated! :)
