## Purpose
In GFR (Global Formula Racing, the student club at my university), we have many items shipped in throughout a season. Any member on the team can receive parts, but not everyone was following the same procedures to notify the team of arrivals (or notifying at all). Significant time was spent coordinating and locating received parts, so this tool was developed to improve the workflow. The goals for this project were (among others), to:

  - Develop a spreadsheet listing each received sponsor part
  - Simplify the process for team members to record a received part
  - Improve the rates of notification (ie. get more students to follow the process)
  - Homogenize delivery notifications to management (ie. standardize the communication methods)
  - Store photos and descriptions of received parts for management use
  
This form allows users to quickly record their received shipment of sponsor parts. User's name and email are pre-filled by utilizing a Google account sign-in to access the form. Information gathered includes sponsor's name, a description of the shipment and context for how this benefits the team, and two methods for attaching photos: by filename (for files already uploaded to team workspace), or by file uploading (which handles sorting in team workspace).
